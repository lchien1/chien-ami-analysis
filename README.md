# chien-ami-analysis
 
This is an analyzer for Amis, built on python. Python code was written to mimic the behavior of https://github.swarthmore.edu/Ling073-sp23/ling073-ami which was built on Apertium tools. Instead of a lexd file, lexicons are written as txt files and patterns are implemented in python code (ami_analyser.py).
